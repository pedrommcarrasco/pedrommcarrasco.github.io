* SpriteKit - SKScene, SKSpriteNode, SKAction, SKPhysicsBody, SKPhysicsContact, SKTexture
* XCTest - Unit testing, Mock, Delegate Spying
* UserDefaults - Highest Score

## Notes
This project was created as a first steps into Spritekit. It follows the MVVM-C pattern, so it can help people learning both MVVM-C and SpriteKit.
