Auto Layout via code can easily create a lot of boilerplate if you don't improve its interface or use one of the amazing frameworks out there. Unfortunately, using a third party framework is not always the answer as you are adding an extra dependency to your codebase.

Bearing that in mind, this presentation was divided into two parts:
* A talk focused in showing the advantages of code when compared to XIBs & Storyboards, issues with external dependencies, problems with the `NSLayoutAnchor` interface and what could be improved
* A workshop/live coding session where I implemented solutions to every identified issue with the `NSLayoutAnchor` interface while keeping Apple's syntax
