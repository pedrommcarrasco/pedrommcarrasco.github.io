Auto Layout via code can easily create a lot of boilerplate if you don't improve its interface or use one of the amazing frameworks out there.

This presentation focused on this issue and was composed of two parts:
* A talk focused in showing the advantages of code when compared to XIBs & Storyboards, external dependencies, problems with the `NSLayoutAnchor`' interface and what could be improved
* A workshop/live coding session where I implemented solutions to every identified issue with the `NSLayoutAnchor` interface
