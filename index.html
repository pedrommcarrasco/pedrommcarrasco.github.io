    Hello there ðŸ‘‹

    I'm Pedro, a portuguese iOS Engineer since February 2017. I've studied at Instituto Superior de Engenharia do Porto and there I've got my bachelor's degree at Software Engineering. Currently, I'm working at Farfetch in Portugal.

    I'm an avid OSS enthusiast and contributor. Help by sharing, learn by what's shared.

    As a person, the whole interaction between humans is something that has always fascinated me and with this in mind, I'm also a conference and meetup organizer, being part of SwiftAveiro and CocoaHeads Porto's organization. In the last 3 years, SwiftAveiro has brought around 250 iOS engineers together and CocoaHeads Porto's proud of being the first CocoaHeads meetup happening in Portugal.


     Here you'll be able to see both personal and professional projects that I've been into, guides, posts and how to contact me.
