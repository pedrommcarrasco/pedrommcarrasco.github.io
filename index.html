    Hello there ðŸ‘‹

    I'm Pedro, a Portuguese iOS Engineer since February 2017. I've studied at Instituto Superior de Engenharia do Porto and there I've got my bachelor's degree in Software Engineering. Currently, I'm working remotely for Doist, the company behind Todoist and Twist.

    I'm an avid OSS enthusiast and contributor. Help by sharing, learn by what's shared.

    Personally, the whole human interaction's something that I've always been fascinated by, and that's why I try to be a part of as many groups and meetups as I possibly can. Due to that, I've been a member of SwiftAveiro's organization, where around 250 iOS Engineers have gathered to learn in the past three years, and CocoaHeads Porto, the first CocoaHeads meetup in Portugal, where people share knowledge by doing speeches and workshops.

    Here you'll be able to see both personal and professional projects that I've been into, guides, posts and how to contact me.
