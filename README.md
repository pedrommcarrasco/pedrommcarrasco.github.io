# Pedro Carrasco's Personal Page

## Intro
Welcome to my personal page repository! Keep in mind that I'm an iOS developer and this is my first attempt at Web Development.

## To do
- Improve Navigation Bar menu
- Divide page into multiple parts instead of a scroll
- Add a list of books (What I'm currently reading, reading next, ...)
- Add a twitter feed section
- Planning to start writing articles (creating section for it and markdown parser)

## Feedback
Any feedback is truly welcome! I'm not english native and so there's always something that can be done in a better different way. I'm also open to design suggestion. You can also submit a Pull Request if you spot some typos or have any design suggestions.
